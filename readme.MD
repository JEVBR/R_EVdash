# EVdash


This is the software V2 of a car dashboard i use to monitor currents, voltages, speed, etc. of the frequency inverter of my DIY electric car.

The car uses a AC inverter based on the project of Paul Holmes. Some video of the dash can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg6Px_q51ew

The inverter sends serial data to a Raspberry PI3 on which this EVdash software is running. The PI3 displays the recieved data on a monitor.

Software uses NODE JS, Socket.io etc to create a localhost. On this localhost the data from serial port is made available to a browser (tested on Firefox).

# Setup (on Raspberry Pi-3 using Ubuntu - Mate)

- TODO

find the serial port:

$ dmesg | grep tty

see its permissions:

$ ls -lh /dev/ttyUSB0 (or whatever name is assigned to your serial port)

set the permission:

$ sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

$ and add you ("user") to dailout group

$ sudo adduser "user" dialout

# Start the server

$ node test.js

in case of an error: cannot open /dev/ttyACM0 or similar, check the serial port and its settings. The port settings are found in the file "local-settings.json"

For my DELL computer, the content of this file is:

{
  "port": "/dev/ttyACM0",
  "device": "DELL"
}

for my PI3 :

{
  "port": "/dev/ttyUSB0",
  "device": "PI3"
}

This file is not included in the git-repo, since it is different depending on which device is used to connect to the serial port. So... make the file by hand.

# Start the browser

go to http://localhost:3000

# Pi3 Startup

To change the USB permissions at startup of the PI3 ad the following line to the SUDO CRONTAB by:

$ sudo crontab -e

add the line:

@reboot chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0 && echo "run SUDO crontab" >> /home/jevbr/code/EVdash/startuplog.log 2>&1

And in the pull down menu "System", "Startup Applications" add the folowing items:

chromium-browser --password-store=basic --kiosk

mate-terminal --working-directory=/home/jevbr/code/EVdash -e 'node test.js'

Also disable "TILDA' in the startup options.
